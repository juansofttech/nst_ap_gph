# Summary of the Tests 📝

## Valid Payments Creation ✅
The first test checks if multiple payments can be created successfully with valid data generated by the `generateMultipleFakePayments` function.

## Invalid `orderId` Length ❌
The second test checks that an error is returned when an invalid `orderId` (too short) is provided.

## Invalid `method` Length ❌
The third test checks that an error is returned when an invalid payment method (too short) is provided.

## Invalid `description` Length ❌
The fourth test checks that an error is returned when a description exceeds the maximum allowed length.

## Processing a Payment Job ⚙️
The fifth test simulates creating a payment job using the `createPaymentJob` mutation. It generates a single fake payment and sends a request to enqueue the job. The test then checks if the `add` method of the mocked job queue was called with the correct parameters.

## Mocking the Job Queue 🎭
The job queue is mocked using Jest, allowing you to verify that the `add` method is called with the expected arguments without actually executing any job processing logic.
