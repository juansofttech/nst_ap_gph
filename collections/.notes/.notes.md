# @auth"TousJuan"
# http response
[In GraphQL, the response format is different from traditional REST APIs. When you create a resource using a mutation, the response typically includes the created resource itself rather than an HTTP status code like 201 Created]


So in this case working with GphQL the [+ expect result] will be:

createOrder mutation was successful and returned the newly created order object.
